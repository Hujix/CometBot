# Note: All progress on this project has been halted. 
Cometbot was a fun and interesting project for me to work on. Today I have made the difficult decision to stop work on the project. The main reason was so that I can spend more time development for my game and a couple other projects.

Remember that this bot is GPLv3, so if you want to fork it you absolutely can. Just change the name and maintain follow the GPLv3 license requirements.

Thank you to all who used/shared my bot.
